This project is based on a prediction with deep neural network models (Convolutional).

Problem: Our goal is to predict from _x-ray-scanner-images_ if there are one or more _prohibited items_.

Data: from https://github.com/lutao2021/PIDray/tree/main -> dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zvMIc1bqteRN9Z36hHYpoTGoZArsh4mE
Literature review: PIDray: A Large-scale X-ray Benchmark for Real-World Prohibited Item Detection di L. Zhang
Method: CNN
Results:... to be continued
